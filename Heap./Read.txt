Priority Queue is implemeted using heap;
There are 2 types of priority queues 


->Min heap;(smallest element is at top or front)
  ->priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;


->max heap;(Largest element is at top or front)
  ->Sysntax priority_queue<int>pq;

->Insertion Complexity->O(log n);
->Deletion Complexity->O(log n);
->Accesing the Element->O(1);
->Searching the Element->O(n);
